# lunetta-building-blocks

these are some of the basic fundamental circuits that make up lunetta synthesizers.

the designs are a means by which i'm teaching myself easyEDA, and for the moment there are only the gerber files. i'll flesh this out as the project progresses.

at present the designs are in the basic preliminary drafting stage, and may be wonky. the boards are presently en route to my home, and i'll be troubleshooting each of them as time allows.

enjoy!!
